we are a design studio working at the intersection of technology, journalism and culture.

<!-- By writing software, building tools and designing interfaces we create websites, spatial installations and printed matters. We collaborate with not-for-profit organizations, journalists, human rights activists, cultural organizations, artists, and researchers. -->

[Currently](history), we retrace the digital architectural process, break down climate scenarios to the local level, and bring new capabilities to our investigative photomatching platform [vantage](https://vantage.thometnanni.net/).

We always welcome [general inquiries and friendly hellos](mailto:hi@thometnanni.net).

Cheers, <br>
Fidel, Giacomo and Julian. <br>
